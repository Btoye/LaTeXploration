# LaTeXploration
A shallow dive into building documents with LaTeX

## Build information - as a pdf
1. Clone the repository/download the file you wish to build
2. Run pdflatex {FILENAME} to make the latex document into the respective pdf

## What this repository demonstrates
* How to write a basic LaTeX document
* The simple syntax to begin writing a document such as '\begin{enumerate}' and '\begin{itemize}'
* How to use ref's and labels to create a dynamic referencing system within a document
* Using the renew command to redefine a section and add your own styles
* the use of key packages such as titlesec and geometry to alter the structure of the page

## Goals
* To create a CV/resume ready template that allows me to explore some LaTeX libraries
* Become capable of creating my own .tex docs without the need for a tutorial
